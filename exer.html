<h2 class="heading123">Tips to play sports</h2>
<hr>
<p>Get in shape. Being in shape will help you have an easier start to your sport season. Start by writing down an exercise plan. If you're having trouble coming up with a plan or workouts, ask your coach, gym teacher, or trainer for advice. If you can't make it to a gym or don't have a lot of time, there are lots of exercise apps and online workouts you can try at home.
</p>
<br><br>
<p>Set realistic goals. While you get ready for the start of your sports season, think of what you want to achieve. Your goals may be general, like making the team or getting in shape. But smaller, specific goals are easier to achieve and can build toward your bigger goal. Be sure to write down your goals and discuss them with your parent or coach â€” they can support you. If you reach your goal, set new goals to work toward. Having goals can be a great motivator!</p>
     <br><br>
     <p>Check your gear. If you're returning to your sport, try on your equipment to make sure it still fits and works for you. If you're new to a sport, ask your coach what you'll need. You can buy your gear secondhand or borrow it from siblings or friends to save money. Make sure all your gear is clean and safe to use. If you're unsure, ask your coach to look at it before the first day of practice.</p>   
<br><br>
<p>Consider a sports camp. Sports camps help new and experienced players practice skills before the season starts. College players, coaches, or other professionals usually teach the camps. Most include drill sessions, then scrimmages toward the end of the day. Drill work helps improve skills. Scrimmaging with other campers lets you practice those skills in real-game situations. Scrimmages also can help you get the feel of playing on a team if it's something you're not used to. Many schools and colleges offer sports camps and clinics during the summer and on the weekends during the school year.
